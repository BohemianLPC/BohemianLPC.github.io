            <p>
            Homotopy type theory started in earnest when Voevodsky formulated his univalence axiom and showed that the category of simplicial sets hosts a model of type theory in which this axiom holds. After he made these contributions, people wondered to which extent this model can be developed in a constructive metatheory and can be exploited for computational purposes. Some serious obstacles were found and in response many researchers switched to cubical sets and started working on "cubical type theories". In joint work with Eric Faber I have developed an approach which seeks to circumvent the obstructions for developing a simplicial sets model for homotopy type theory in a constructive fashion. In this talk I will try to give some idea of how we try to do this, what we have achieved thus far and how our project compares to related ones by Gambino, Henry, Szumilo and Sattler. </p>
